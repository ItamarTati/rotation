# Rotation 

Rotation is a website that encrypts any message by rotating the letters of the Alphabet

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install Rotation.

```bash
npm install
npm start 
```

## Instructions
You are required to create a basic program which implements the basis of a ROT-13 algorithm, taking a string as an input and replacing each letter with the 13th letter after it. For example if I input "hello world" it should return "uryyb jbeyq". You should be able to customize the rotation value. IE I should be able to change 13 to any number [ n ] between 1 and 25 and it will replace each letter with the nth letter after it. It should not change punctuation or numbers It should be case sensitive (BONUS) build a client side interface for the program where the user can enter the string and rotation value and then see the returned output Test Cases:  Rotation: 13, User Input: "Hello World", Expected Output: "Uryyb Jbeyq" Rotation: 13, User Input: "The Number 16.", Expected Output: "Gur Ahzore 16." Rotation: 19, User Input: "Hello World!", Expected Output: "Axeeh Phkew!"
